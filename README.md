## WARNING

Do not expect any of this to compile, not even to make sense.
It's a toy project, a side project.
I write a couple of lines when I get bored 
but don't have time to do something proper, for example
when there is a couple of minutes to fill because I have to
wait for a build but not enough time to switch to a proper task.

## Project Goals

1. Fill time. 
2. Write as easy and simple as possible.
3. Create some code to track and summarize time spent on
different tasks and projects.
