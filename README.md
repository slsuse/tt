# tt

## Project Goals

1. Use leftover minutes.
2. Write the code as easy and simple as possible.
3. Create some code to track and summarize time spent on different tasks and projects.
4. Practice git.
5. Parallel tasks and projects, e.g clocked in waiting for a phone call and
   clocked in producing bugs for tt while clocked in at work.
6. KISS principle: UNIX command line interface and plain text files (csv).
7. NFS save.

## Usage:

TT_DB="test.csv"  ./tt -p ls
